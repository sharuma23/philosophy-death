```
  “I care about my lyrics, I spend time on my lyrics, just like f*****g 
  homework man, it's a pain in the a**, but it means a lot. Some bands don't care,
  some bands think, if you don't sing about satan... How limited satan is.
  How many times can I sing about demonic angels killing nuns? 
  That's lame, I've never sang about it and I never will.”
  ```
--

  Interviewer: “Do you think those bands that sing about it give this type of music a bad name?”

--

  ```“Totally! For anyone to go around limiting this type of music to just being satanic and whatever... raw and noisy, that is so narrow minded.”```

# .indigo-text[Applied Ethics]

---
class: bg-black-white-text

## Debating what is .green-text[right] or .red-text[wrong], 
--
or what is .green-text[good] or .red-text[bad], 
--
has occurred for thousands of years, 
--
starting with early .pink-text[philosophers], 
--
such as .indigo-text[Socrates and Plato], 
--
and now with modern .pink-text[philosophers] in the present age.

--
###The term used referred to this debate is .indigo-text[**ethics.**] 

--
We use .indigo-text[ethics] in our daily lives for .indigo-text[debating] the .indigo-text[morality] of our actions and using .indigo-text[reason] to support such arguments

# A current ethical debate would be .indigo-text[abortion].

--
### There are two main sides to the debate:

--
<div style="padding:1em; background-color: black;">
  .green-text[Pro-choice] - this side belives that a .indigo-text[woman should have the right to decide] if she wants to .indigo-text[birth] a child or not; women should have the choice.
</div>

--

<div style="padding:1em; background-color: black;">
  .red-text[Pro-life] - this side mainly believes that abortion is the .red-text[same as killing a baby]; they believe that a new life should not be prevented from coming into this world. Many of these beliefs also stem from traditional, religious ideals.
</div>

---
class: bg-black-white-text

# Chuck himself sided with .green-text[Pro-Choice], stating:

--
### “It should be .green-text[legal]. If I was a woman, surely I would like to have a .indigo-text[choice] to have a child or not,” in a 1995 interview with .red-text[*Spark Magazine*].

--
### .indigo-text[*“Altering the Future”*] conveys his perspective.

“Creating a life only to destroy

--
#### One major argument in .green-text[favor] of abortion is that some women are .red-text[simply not prepared to be mothers].

--

* This is especially true for .red-text[teenagers] who become pregnant, often .red-text[lacking the resources] to care for a child.

--

* According to “Understanding why women seek abortions in the US,” an article published in the **peer-reviewed journal** .pink-text[*BMC Women’s Health*], “The predominant themes identified as **reasons** for seeking abortion included .indigo-text[financial reasons (40%), timing (36%)].”

--
* As a result, children that grow up in .red-text[economically poor circumstances] often steer to .red-text[crime] due to a .red-text[lack of opportunity] in terms of employment, especially in .red-text[low-income neighborhoods].

### According to an article published in the .pink-text[*British Journal of Psychiatry*], “.red-text[Low socioeconomic status] in childhood is a well-known .red-text[predictor] of subsequent .red-text[criminal and substance misuse behaviours]”.

### Evidently, Chuck argues that .indigo-text[taking a chance] for the .red-text[possibility] of a happy life is simply .red-text[not worth it.]

### The mother should have a .green-text[choice] in birthing the child.

“Death and life taken so easily

### In my opinion, this refers to how some .red-text[people] are purely viewing the debate as a .indigo-text[question of morality], .red-text[ignoring reason]. 
--
It simply isn’t about being .red-text[right or wrong], it’s about dealing with .green-text[human life]. 
--
Being right or being wrong is the matter of a child being .indigo-text[brought into this world]. 
--
The mother should have a .green-text[choice] in giving birth, as it is .indigo-text[her body, her child, and her biological responsibility.]

“In the U.S, a lot of .pink-text[**newborns**] are .red-text[**killed**] because they were .red-text[**unwanted**].

.center[
.indigo-text[***“All…are”***] refers to the concept of .pink-text[**forgiveness and protection from God**]. 
]
--
After committing .red-text[bad acts] or .red-text[sins], many people ask for .pink-text[forgiveness] by .pink-text[praying] to God, ensuring they will go to Heaven as opposed to Hell.

--

This idea is established in the .pink-text[***New Testament, Matthew 7:7***], stating .indigo-text[***“Ask and it will be given to you.”***] 
--
However, .pink-text[prayers or asking for forgiveness] or anything from God .red-text[**does not change**] the fact that a .red-text[**bad act was committed**]. 
--
In terms of the song, a .red-text[**devoted follower killed someone**]; regardless of prayers, a life has been taken and .indigo-text[**nothing can change that**].

class: bg-black-white-text

## .maroon-text[**Epistemology**] is the branch of philosophy that focuses on the .indigo-text[theory of knowledge]. 
--
How do we .indigo-text[know] of such knowledge? 
--
Is this knowledge .indigo-text[valid?] 
--

## From epistemology stems .maroon-text[**skepticism**]. 
--
In philosophical terms, 
--
skepticism is the idea that .red-text[nothing can be absolutely known or proved.]

## .green-text[A radical way to look at these two concepts is the idea that we live in a simulation (i.e. .green-text[*The Matrix*]).]

.pink-text[Philosophers] pose ideas regarding .maroon-text[human nature], 
--
attempting to .indigo-text[explain and comprehend such phenomena.] 
--
Chuck is clearly .red-text[against] such .red-text[generalizations] of the human nature. 


---
class: bg-black-white-text, center, middle

### .maroon-text[***“Do…hear”***] explains how philosophers .maroon-text[cannot speak] on the behalf of other people as 
--
they .red-text[do not experience the same things as them.] 

--
### .indigo-text[How can one create such **assumptions** and **explanations** of the **internal workings** of an individual being a **completely different** person?] 

---
class: bg-black-white-text

### I believe the main point that Chuck is trying to convey is that it is .maroon-text[foolish to make generalizations and assertions of human nature], 
--
especially for .indigo-text[individuals], 
--
when all humans are .maroon-text[simply different]; 
--
he is highly .maroon-text[**skeptical**] of the .maroon-text[**validity**] of .indigo-text[philosophical knowledge].

--
.center[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Chuck_Schuldiner_%28cropped%29.jpg">]

???
“The Philosopher” demonstrates both of these concepts, with Chuck’s skepticism of the validity and use of modern-day philosophers.

--
.maroon-text[***“Lie…others”***] suggests how the basis of .indigo-text[**philosophical ideals**] are .indigo-text[**invalid assumptions**], 
--
having no basis of truth. 
--
Philosophers then use such ideals to .red-text[judge others.]

--

.maroon-text[***“You…all”***] demonstrates Chuck’s belief that the .indigo-text[so-called "knowledge"] of philosophers is essentially .red-text[useless] in today’s society. 
--
Philosophers .red-text[lack practical application] from Chuck’s perspective, 
--
as he believes the .maroon-text[basis of their ideals are **invalid** and **flawed**.]

## .maroon-text[***“Your…own”***] can be seen as a reference to the .red-text[lack of originality for philosophical ideals]. 
--
Modern philosophers still use the ideals of old philosophers, 
--
such as .indigo-text[Socrates and Plato], 
--
simply believing these ideals .pink-text[hold validity] due to their **wide acceptance** and **reputation**.

---
class: bg-black-white-text

## .maroon-text[***“What…choice”***] refers to the .red-text[**bias**] when coming to .indigo-text[**intellectual and philosophical decisions**]. 
--
I think a simple way to interpret this line is the common saying .maroon-text[***“It sounds and looks smart.”***] 
--
Philosophers may .red-text[fail] to .maroon-text[accept straightforward] explanations and answers to common questions, 
--
simply because it .red-text[undermines] their profession of .maroon-text[deeply questioning concepts.]

---
class: bg-black-white-text

### .maroon-text[***“So…sexuality”***] refers to the .red-text[duality] of human nature. 

--
### I personally think this line implies that Chuck wrote this song, not only aimed towards the specific profession of philosophers, but .red-text[people in general] who impose philosophical ideals. 

--
### People .maroon-text[**judge and assert**] how life should be led, experienced, and how the thought process works. 
--
Yet, these same people consist of individuals who themselves are .red-text[**unsure of their identity**]. 
--
In the context of the song, .pink-text[**sexual identity**]. 

---
class: bg-black-white-text

## I think it’s pretty safe to say that Chuck is critiquing the demographic of people who .maroon-text[**teach others about their lives, yet lack an understanding of their own life.**]

# **Determinism vs Free Will**
---
class: bg-black-white-text

## .maroon-text[**Determinism vs Free Will**] is a debate regarding the .indigo-text[chain of events that occur in life.] 

--
###The side of .maroon-text[**determinism**] believes that all events occur in a chain of .indigo-text[causes and effects]. 
--
Essentially, .pink-text[free will] simply .red-text[does not exist] 
--
and events occur as a result of .maroon-text[external forces] that we have .indigo-text[no control over.] 

--
For example, the event of me presenting this project right now was caused by the .green-text[interactions of specific molecules that occurred prior.]

class: bg-black-white-text

### .maroon-text[**Free will**], on the other hand, is the idea that humans have .maroon-text[full control] over the events that can occur 
--
as a result of .indigo-text[**their actions and choices**;] 
--
there is .red-text[no pre-set course of events] to take place, we have .maroon-text[**control**] over the actions that can result in such events.

class: bg-black-white-text

## Chuck portrays this idea with .maroon-text[***“Destiny”***]. 
--
The track is centered around .red-text[two individuals] 
--
who have a .indigo-text[strong relationship] with each other, 
--
presumably .pink-text[lovers], 
--
and how one of them .maroon-text[contemplates] the events that transpired between the two, 
--
concluding it was .red-text[destiny’s decision.]

---
class: bg-black-white-text

# Before we analyze the lyrics of the song, 
--
it is important to .indigo-text[truly understand] the meaning of .maroon-text[destiny] 
--
and where it falls in terms of .maroon-text[determinism and free will.]

---
class: bg-black-white-text
## A commonly accepted definition of .maroon-text[destiny] is that it refers to something that is .indigo-text[supposed to happen.] 
  
* As the definition of destiny is .red-text[abstract] in itself, it can fall towards .pink-text[determinism or free will].

--

    * In terms of .red-text[determinism], destiny may essentially be the .red-text[ultimate outcome] of all the .maroon-text[prior events] that took place, including the pre-set course of our actions (which took place due to external forces).

--
  * In terms of .indigo-text[free will], destiny may be the .red-text[“destination”] that an individual is .maroon-text[supposed to reach]. However, they have complete .green-text[freedom and choice] over the actions they may take. The actions will, ultimately, lead towards that destined destination.

###** The unexpected I sometimes fear**

###** Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens**

###** When things fall into place”**
]]
--

.maroon-text[***“Time…fear”***] can be interpreted as the narrator’s .red-text[**concern**] for the .red-text[**unpredictability**] of life. 
--
Events can .maroon-text[occur] without any prior warning, often .pink-text[surprising] or shocking people. 
--
.indigo-text[The prime example of this would be unexpected tragedy, a very common fear among people.]

---
class: bg-black-white-text

## From .pink-text[my perspective], .maroon-text[***“Just…place”***] sets up the narrator's .red-text[belief in determinism] for the course of their life. 
--
.maroon-text[***“...no excuse for what happens When things fall into place”***] portrays the idea that events 
--
in life .indigo-text[occur according to a predetermined plan (hence, “things fall into place”)]

--

## This section of the lyrics .red-text[**enforces**] the narrator's perspective that .maroon-text[**life is deterministic**]. 

--
In the case of the narrator’s life, this .maroon-text[determinism] is .indigo-text[applied] to their .pink-text[relationship] with another person, appearing to be a relationship of .pink-text[**love**]. 

--
  * They have to .maroon-text[endure the predetermined events] causing them .red-text[**pain**]. 
--
Getting through these events, however, will build a .pink-text[deep connection], allowing the lovers to .indigo-text[fully understand and see their connection (.pink-text[“find the other half that is true”]).]

### .maroon-text[***“Years…life”***] refers to the narrator .indigo-text[**questioning**] the .indigo-text[purpose] behind the events that took place.

### .pink-text[Just to put my opinion out there], 
--
.green-text[I think the determinism vs free-will debate also functions as a way to deal with guilt.]

.red-text[People may use determinism to assert that they had no fault in certain events,]

.center[<img height="250" src="https://images.everydayhealth.com/images/chronic-guilt-in-the-era-of-covid-722x406.jpg">]

???
* “Destiny” is one of my favorite songs on the album. The heavy main riff, paired with the upbeat rhythm never fails to make me headbang. But more importantly, the lyrics really enforce the idea that we simply have no control over the occurrence of certain events. Chuck portrayed the ideal of destiny and determinism through a lover’s reflection of the events that took place throughout their relationship. Perhaps this song was of great importance to Chuck, where he himself was the narrator depicted in the song.

Now, I won’t be exploring the other songs as they are essentially all themed around the Philosophy of the Mind. I personally like to view this album as an expansion upon “Within the Mind” from *Spiritual Healing*, with the tracks exploring the human entity.

### .maroon-text[***Individual Thought Patterns***] was and is an amazing album, 
--
demonstrating the musical genius behind .red-text[**Death**]. 
--
The album really .green-text[solidified] the band’s movement towards a more .indigo-text[technical and progressive tune] on the .red-text[instrumental side], 
--
while building upon .pink-text[relatable themes] such as .indigo-text[issues in society] 
--
and the .indigo-text[natures of the human mind] for .red-text[lyrical content]. 
--
Chuck continues to develop this .red-text[instrumental and lyrical style] in his last two albums, 
--
.purple-text[***Symbolic***] 
--
and .red-text[***The Sound of Perseverance***].

I won’t be covering Chuck’s last two albums, *Symbolic* and *The Sound of Perseverance*, for the sake of time (also because I already hit all the concepts I needed 🤘). However, they are no exception from Chuck’s musical genius. *Symbolic* is often considered to be the peak of Death’s musical prowess, with wide acclaim and praise for the unique instrumental tone and catchy riffs employed in the album.

* *Death* has been an extremely important band to me. Chuck’s music emphasized the importance of deep, meaningful lyrics in songs. He helped me understand the importance of conversing with meaning, with significance, with understanding the explanation and reasoning behind things. I strive to be like Chuck: a musical and guitar genius, a positive, open minded person, and a man of meaningful words and wisdom.
