# The Philosophy of Death 
#### By Shivansh Sharma

## What is Metal?

* Metal is genre of music that developed in the late 1960s, gaining popularity in the 70s and 80s
* The genre itself is a heavier step-up from rock, primarily defined by distorted guitar tunes, extravagant guitar solos, and unorthodox singing styles
* The pioneers of the genre are known to be Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, all founded in England 
    * They became famous for their uncanny vocal styles and distorted guitar riffs
    * Out of the three, most metalheads will agree that Black Sabbath has been the most influential on the genre
        * Play “Black Sabbath” by Black Sabbath on Black Sabbath


## What is Death Metal?



* Death Metal is an extreme subgenre of metal that developed in the early 1980s
* The genre is defined by heavily down-tuned guitar tones, aggressive vocal styles involving growling and screeching, rapid riff and beat changes, and lyrics based on issues in society, violence, science-fiction, and philosophy 
* The band *Death*, founded in Florida in 1983, are known to be one of the pioneers of the genre 
    * Scream Bloody Gore was their debut album, pioneering the extreme subgenre of death metal
* A common misconception among most people nowadays is that death metal is purely satanic music, involving extremely fast instrumentals, brutal growling, and corpse paint
    * Chuck Schuldiner, the founder of Death, was very much against this ideal, stating in a 1991 interview published by the well-known metal magazine company “Thrash ‘n Burn”:
        * “I care about my lyrics, I spend time on my lyrics, just like f\*\*\*\*\*g homework man, it's a pain in the a**, but it means a lot. Some bands don't care , some bands think, if you don't sing about satan... How limited satan is. How many times can I sing about demonic angels killing nuns? That's lame, I've never sang about it and I never will.”
        * “Do you think those bands that sing about it give this type of music a bad name?”
            * “Totally! For anyone to go around limiting this type of music to just being satanic and whatever... raw and noisy, that is so narrow minded.”


## Mantas



* *Death* was founded in Altamonte Springs in 1983, originally formed as the *Mantas*
* Charles "Chuck" Schuldiner founded the band at the age of 16, along with Barney 'Kam' Lee as the vocalist and drummer and Rick Rozz as the rhythm guitarist (Chuck being the lead)
* As the Mantas, the trio managed to record 2 demos: “Emotional” and “Death by Metal”
    * The demos did an excellent job of pushing thrash metal to the limits, especially with such amazing talent at this young of an age 
    * The tapes incorporated themes of violence and horror-movies, paired with guttural vocals and heavily down-tuned guitars; a significant stepping stone for the development of the genre
    * ***Cue songs 


## Death



* In 1984, the Mantas split up for a brief period of time.
* Chuck wanted to start a new band, simply called* Death*
    * However, after searching for applicable members for a few weeks, Chuck resorted to forming the band with Rozz and Lee
* In the month of October, the band records the “Reign of Terror,” their 5 track demo 
    * The demo builds upon the *Mantas*’ earlier works of “Emotional” and “Death by Metal,” with Chuck becoming the guttural lead vocalist 
* Rozz and Lee soon leave the band, with Chuck constantly searching and dismissing new band members
* Death is known for having a completely fresh line-up for each album, creating a unique and distinct tune through each run 
    * Chuck was known to be a perfectionist, having very high standards for bandmates. Consequently, this made it difficult for him to consistently work and agree with others, resulting in constant line-up changes.


## Scream Bloody Gore



* *Scream Bloody Gore* was Death’s first, officially released album 
* The album was met with great success, gaining fame as the defining album of the death metal genre, receiving positive reviews from critics and fans alike 
* *AllMusic*, a popular music database service, has given the album a rating of 5 stars, with fans agreeing and rating it similarly 
* The album employed themes of gore and violence, taking heavy inspiration from horror movies 
    * *The Human Factor* interview
    * According to an interview published in 1997 by *Metal Forces, *a popular magazine company focused on heavy metal and hard rock music, Chuck explained, “My lyrics are based more on the subject of death and real-life gore.”
    * “I get a lot of ideas from seeing gore flicks”
    * “ 'Torn To Pieces' is about the movie 'Make Them Die Slowly' ”
    * “ 'Scream Bloody Gore' is about 'Re-animator' ”
* As a gore-focused album, Chuck used a great deal of **imagery** when writing his songs 
    * Chuck utilizes descriptive language to help headbangers develop a mental-image of the scene 
    * A great example of this is seen in *Scream Bloody Gore *
        * “Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh
            Leaving your body a bloody mess”

* Evidently, Chuck was fond of using a gorey, bloody dialect, essentially transcribing a scene from a horror movie
* Like many other death metal bands at the time, Chuck’s music essentially reflected the young, rebellious teenage mind he had, conveying the chaos and defiance within his brain 


## Leprosy



* *Leprosy*, the band’s second album, was released in 1988
* Similar to *Scream Bloody Gore*, the album was primarily themed around death and gore
    * However, the lyrical content was much more mature, employing more serious themes of real-life death
* In the heavy metal community, the album is seen as the defining album that made the band *Death*
    * Each song was themed around a concept of death 
    * The title of the album itself is “Leprosy,” a deadly, ancient disease that decimated lives throughout history
* Various philosophical themes can be identified throughout the tracks
* **Philosophy of Technology**
    * “Pull the Plug” is a song that is focused upon the direct dependence humans have on technology
        * Specifically, life support 
    * An excerpt from the lyrics:
        * “Memories is all that's left behind
        * As I lay and wait to die
        * Little do they know
        * That I hear their choice of life”
        * “Pull the plug
        * Let me pass away
        * Pull the plug
        * Don't want to life this way”
    * Chuck refers to medically incapacitated patients who have lost the ability to make decisions 
        * Often times, many of these patients retain full sensory awareness while being unable to move any part of their body 
        * “Little do they know, That I hear their choice of life” refers to patients that listen to doctors and their loved ones making decisions for their survival 
            * This can mean being put on life support forcefully or having it removed, resulting in either lifelong suffering or your death
                * Another reason why advance directives are absolutely necessary
            * Pulling the plug on life support is often the only way to prevent a lifetime of suffering, hence the title of the song
        * Chuck demonstrated the negative effects brought upon humanity by technological advancements through the lens of a tragedy that all of us may unfortunately experience one day 
            * Technology can now dictate whether we live or die, controlling our fate, and ultimately becoming a dependency of human life
* **Anarchy**
    * *Leprosy* portrays a unique take on anarchy through “Primitive Ways” and “Left to Die”
    * But first off, what is anarchy?
        * According to the Oxford dictionary, anarchy is defined as the state of disorder caused by the absence of authority 
        * A real-world example would be Kabul, Afghanistan 
            * The Taliban takeover is a prime example of anarchists taking control of a region due to a lack of enforcing authority 
            * The city of Kabul is in now in immense disorder and chaos 
    * “Primitive Ways” and “Left to Die” set up a cause and effect relationship for anarchy 
        * “Primitive Ways” lyrically depicts a society of primitive cannibals, highlighting the brutal practices celebrated in this society 
            * Excerpt from the lyrics:
            * “Go against the ways and experience pain
            * Leading a life which one might call insane
            * Bathe in the blood of the one you killed
            * Slaughter to survive, Your needs are fulfilled”
            * “Cannibals practicing the art of butchery”
            * “Conducting ceremonies to meet the ancient ones”
        * Evidently, Chuck describes a society in chaos compared to our standards 
            * However, in the mind of primitive cannibals, their society is flawless and normal 
            * “Go against the ways” places emphasis on the idea of opposing accepted ideals and authority, a core component of anarchy 
            * “Conducting ceremonies to meet the ancient ones” demonstrates the success of the cannibalistic takeover, carrying out their ideal practices and ceremonies in their version of an ideal society
    * “Left to Die” appears to portray the effects of anarchy, mainly death in this case
        * Excerpt from the lyrics:
        * “Put your life into their hands
        * Die for someone else”
        * “The first blood shed does not seem real
        * Reality is what you feel
        * Dropping to your knees you pray
        * God won't make this go away”
        * “Legs blown off, All hope is lost
        * A human life is what it cost
        * Others follow close behind
        * A real adventure they will find”
    * Chuck is essentially narrating the revelation of a soldier on the battlefield, experiencing the last moments of their life 
        * “Put your life into their hands” refers to the higher-ups in government and military deciding the fate of soldiers
        * “Reality is what you feel” refers to the “awakening” soldiers experience when they are about to face death
            * Individuals contemplate the decisions they’ve made in life once they realize they are about to pass away
    * Anarchy often results in war, most oftenly due to conflicts between rebel groups and central authorities 
        * Societies like those described in “Primitive Ways” often start such conflicts, resulting in death and chaos as portrayed in “Left to Die”


## Spiritual Healing



* *Spiritual Healing* is the band’s third album, released in 1990
* The album was a very distinctive turn for the band, moving away from the harsh brutality and death-focused theme towards a more polished, philosophical take on issues in society, such as abortion, drug use, and religion
    * It was essentially Chuck’s perspective on our society at the time, almost like a death metal commentary
* The album was looked down upon by many headbangers, believing it strayed from the raw brutality of *Death*’s original works 
    * Chuck’s comments, from the same *Thrash ‘n Burn* interview published in 1991, regarding the change in sound:
        * “I hear people say that if you're not a million miles per hour and satanic, you're not death metal, and that's not my idea of what death metal is. Death metal is a feel, a sound, not a limited instrument deal, or limited production deal. It's a sound, it's not a specific, limited approach to music."
* **Philosophy of Mind**
    * *Spiritual Healing* does an excellent job of portraying Chuck’s perspective on the nature of the human mind 
        * We see this in “Within the Mind”, which conveys Chuck’s view on bringing out the best of our minds to enhance our lives 
    * But first of all, what is the mind?
        * Biologically, the mind is our brain, the CPU of our body. It controls the nervous system and all of our bodily functions. 
        * Philosophically, the mind is the source of our reason, consciousness, and our understanding of the world
            * Our actions are determined by our reasoning and morality, hence making the mind an important factor of our life
            * Chuck does an excellent job of portraying this through “Within the Mind”
    * Lyrics: 
        * “Transforming your mind from the inside out
        * Overcoming fear that made you doubt
        * Observing what is stored in the subconscious
        * Trusting what you feel with your gut responses
        * See past the dark and use your energy
        * Learn from these images
        * Thoughts that we call dreams
        * This power lies within the mind
        * Gain wisdom through abilities
        * Change what's to come in future time
        * Avoiding pain and misery
        * Look through the fake from what is real
        * Making decisions by what you feel
        * Live for the future and not the past
        * The weak of mind will never last
        * Perceiving visions that reoccur
        * Analyze your dreams to gain
        * A better perspective of your life
        * In control of your destiny with mind and soul
        * See past the dark and use your energy
        * Learn from these images
        * Thoughts that we call dreams
        * This power lies within the mind
        * Gain wisdom through abilities
        * Change what's to come in future time
        * Avoiding pain and misery”
    * The lyrics convey Chuck’s perspective on how people should overcome the troubles of the human mind
        * “Overcoming fear that made you doubt” refers to the fears of an individual which prevent them from taking action in life, hence doubting these paths of action
            * Overcoming fear will result in confidence and control over your mind and your actions, allowing you to become assertive in life 
        * “Trusting what you feel with your gut responses”, also self-explanatory, refers to relying on your “gut feelings”
            * “Gut feelings” are essentially confident assertions that don’t come from reason, but from our primal instinct 
                * This sensation is often trusted by individuals as it is similar to a defense mechanism, almost like a bodily response to deal with threats 
        * Now, I could explain every line’s importance to the Philosophy of Mind, but that would take ages…
          * So here’s a brief summary:
            * Chuck believes that humans should take control of their mind for the betterment of their lives, and most importantly, learning from past mistakes and developing into a stronger person 
                * Overcome your fears
                * Trust your gut instincts
                * Look at the bigger picture of things
                * Improve on your skills and abilities to build wisdom 
                * Take action to prevent misery and misfortune in the future 
                * Look at the truth, looking past superficial facades
                * Don’t get stuck in the past
                * Pay attention to your dreams to understand what truly radiates within in your mind 
            * If we can prioritize these aspects, we can overcome the weak points of our mind and change our life for the better
* **Truth**
    * Truth is defined as the concept of something being in accordance with facts or reality 
    * Truth plays an extremely important role in our society and being, as it impacts our beliefs, which ultimately impact our actions 
    * “Low Life” presents the effects of lying (the opposite of truth) on individuals in a society, turning them into society’s scum; low-lifes.
        * Excerpt from the lyrics:
            * “Fake is the word you represent
            * Your existence on earth I resent
            * At the cost of others you get by
            * Each word that you speak is a lie”
            * “Hiding behind material values
            * That help cover up your weakness
            * Never to change, always to look
            * For an easy way out of life”
        * Chuck demonstrates the detrimental effects of lying through the analysis of a low-life in society
            * According to Chuck, a low-life makes it through life primarily by lying
                * “Fake is the word you represent…At the cost of others you get by” - low-lifes use lying as their primary driver of life as opposed to hardwork and determination 
                    * Lies can be used to manipulate others, harming them in exchange for selfish benefits 
                * Continuous lying would essentially result in a society of low-lifes - individuals incapable of hard work, trust, responsibility, open-minded thinking, and deceit 
                    * A successful society simply cannot be built upon these truth-lacking ideals as genuine communication and unity will be unachievable
* **Philosophy of Science**
    * The Philosophy of Science is focused on analyzing the implications of science on society and humanity 
    * Evidently, scientific advancements have progressed the advancement of society by improving the lives of humans 
        * A prime example would be advancements in the medical sciences 
            * Developments such as the creation of vaccines have helped combat life-threatening diseases, such as small-pox
            * Developments in genetic sciences have helped prevent hereditary diseases from passing down to younger generations 
        * Without the history of advancements in the sciences, society would not be as successful as it is today
    * However, the capabilities of such advancements in technology and science have serious implications on humanity
        * Chuck addresses these implications in “Genetic Reconstruction”
    * The song focuses on the dangers of giving humans excessive control over genetics, allowing scientists to methodically create human life with specific traits and abilities in mind 
        * Excerpt from the lyrics:
            * “Extending a life
            * With total resistance
            * To fatal disease
            * Future methods of science”
            * \--------------------------------------------
            * “Replacing what is real by using technology
            * Population control
            * Selecting those who will breed
            * A specific type of form
            * Chosen for the unborn
            * A mind without emotion
            * Progressive anatomy”
            * \---------------------------------------------
            * “Genetic reconstruction
            * Evolution in production”
            * \---------------------------------------------
            * “Producing a race of human machines
            * A new age of existence the world will see”
            * \------------------------------------------------
        * “Extending...science” refers to the technology allowing us to alter the genetic patterns of human, giving us immunity to dangers that normal humans are vulnerable to
            * An example of this would be certain genetic diseases
                * [According to an article published on gene therapy by the University of Missouri School of Medicine,](https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/health-ethics/faq/gene-therapy#:~:text=Gene%20therapy%20seeks%20to%20alter,organism%20beyond%20what%20is%20normal)
                    * “Gene therapy seeks to alter genes to correct genetic defects and thus prevent or cure genetic diseases. Genetic engineering aims to modify the genes to enhance the capabilities of the organism beyond what is normal.”
            * “Selecting…emotion” refers to the immense control scientists will have over human behavior 
                * Genetic modifications can allow scientists to control aspects of the brain, such as the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for controlling your emotions 
                    * A major implication arises from this; humanity can create emotionless humans, lacking a moral compass 
                        * The movies *Gemini Man* and *Robocop* (2014) demonstrate the use-cases for such alterations, mainly for military purposes 
                            * An emotionless human is the perfect killing machine, biologically lacking emotion with only the capability to follow orders 
                                * Hence, the lyric “Producing a race of human machines”
    * The implications for scientific advancements pose various ethical concerns, especially for genetic advancements and the alteration of human life
* **Applied Ethics**
    * Debating what is right or wrong, or what is good or bad, has occurred for thousands of years, starting with early philosophers, such as Socrates and Plato, and now with modern philosophers in the present age
        * The term used referred to this debate is **ethics** 
        * We use ethics in our daily lives, debating the morality of an action and using reason to support such arguments 
    * A current ethical debate would be abortion
        * There are two main sides to the debate:
            * Pro-choice - this side belives that a woman should have the right to decide if she wants to birth a child or not; women should have the choice.
            * Pro-life - this side mainly believes that abortion is the same as killing a baby; they believe that a new life should not be prevented from coming into this world. Many of these beliefs also stem from traditional, religious ideals.
    * Chuck himself sided with Pro-Choice, stating:
        * “It should be legal. If I was a woman, surely I would like to have a choice to have a child or not,” in a 1995 interview with *Spark Magazine*
        * “Altering the Future” conveys his perspective 
    * Excerpt from the Lyrics:
        * “Creating a life only to destroy
        * Saved from a life of the unemployed
        * Where crime is the only way to survive
        * Which is the best to be dead or alive?”
        * \-------------------------------------------------------
            * One major argument in favor of abortion is that some women are simply not prepared to be mothers 
                * This is especially true for teenagers who become pregnant, often lacking the resources to care for a child
                    * According to a research article, “Understanding why women seek abortions in the US,” published in the peer-reviewed journal *BMC Women’s Health*, “The predominant themes identified as reasons for seeking abortion included financial reasons (40%), timing (36%)”
                * As a result, children that grow up in economically poor circumstances often steer to crime due to a lack of opportunity in terms of employment, especially in low-income neighborhoods
                    * According to an article published in the *British Journal of Psychiatry*, “Low socioeconomic status in childhood is a well-known predictor of subsequent criminal and substance misuse behaviours” 
        * “Maybe a chance but maybe not
        * Born to be thrown in the trash to rot
        * To exist in this world may be a mistake
        * The one who is with child
        * It's their choice to make”
            * Evidently, Chuck argues that taking a chance for the possibility of a happy life is simply not worth it. The mother should have a choice in birthing the child.
        * \-------------------------------------------------------
        * “Death and life taken so easily
        * Right or wrong
        * Whose choice will it be?”
            * In my opinion, this refers to how people view the debate as a question of morality, ignoring reason. It simply isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about dealing with human life. Being right or being wrong is the matter of a child being brought into this world. The mother should have a choice in giving birth, as it is her body, her child, and her biological responsibility. 
        * \-------------------------------------------------------
        * “Abortion when it is needed
        * Execution for those who deserve it”
            * In the same interview with Spark Magazine in 1995, Chuck explained, “In the U.S, a lot of newborns are killed because they were unwanted. It is better to solve it immediately when a woman finds out about the pregnancy and she’s doesn’t want a child.”
* **Philosophy of Religion**
    * Religious ideals have controlled our society for thousands of years 
        * They provided humans with explanations for phenomena they couldn’t comprehend 
        * They helped guide humans by providing rules and the basis for a moral compass 
            * However, the moral compasses endorsed by religions have undergone questioning, especially since people have become individualistic, relying on the principles of reason
                * “Spiritual Healing” demonstrates the implications of the immense control religions have over their followers, highlighting the hypocrisy of such devotees. 
    * Excerpt from the lyrics:
        * “Always blocking the doors to your mind
        * Escaping the reality that surrounds you
        * Using faith as an excuse to kill
        * A sick way of life is now revealed”
            * “Always…you” refers to the way religion can control the minds of dedicated followers. This is especially evident among extremist groups, such as Islamic Extremists. These radicals are so heavily invested in Islam that they fail to accept reality the way it is, only believing that the world described in their religious text is correct (the Q’uran for Islamists).
        * \----------------------------------------------------------
        * “All the prayers in the world can't help you now
        * A killer a taker of life is what you are”
            * “All…are” refers to the concept of forgiveness and protection from God. After committing bad acts or sins, many people ask for forgiveness by praying to God, ensuring they will go to Heaven as opposed to Hell. 
            * This idea is established in the New Testament, Matthew 7:7, stating “Ask and it will be given to you.” However, prayers or asking for forgiveness or anything from God does not change the fact that a bad act was committed. In terms of the song, a devoted follower killed someone; regardless of prayers, a life has been taken and nothing can change that.
        * \----------------------------------------------------------
        * “Preach the good word
        * Speak no more, prepare to burn”
            * “Preach…burn” refers to the duality of religious figures. These figures preach others to do good, committing morally good acts of their faith. However, these same preachers often commit sins, sending them to Hell (hence, “prepare to burn”). A prime example of this would be Priests that committed simony, the buying or selling of spiritual privileges (for example, selling or buying an indulgence).
        * Chuck highly opposed organized religion, and we will see this materialize in later albums.
* *Spiritual Healing* was a sharp turn for Death. Chuck moved away from the gore-focused, raw sound and themes of *Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy,* and headed towards a more polished, technical sound while creating a lyrical focus on societal issues, exploring various philosophical ideals. 


## Human



* *Human* is the 4th album recorded by the band, released in 1991
* The album builds upon Death’s movement towards a more technical, polished sound, building upon the same philosophical themes that emerged with *Spiritual Healing*
* The tracks are primarily themed around the aspects of humans, especially regarding human nature and its implications towards society
    * However, one track particularly stands out as it examines the broader impact of such human tendencies 
* **Environmental Philosophy + The Philosophy of Space and Time**
    * “Vacant Planets” describes the harm human tendencies have done to society and the planet of Earth through a broader, extra-terrestrial lens
        * It’s almost as if the track order implied this, as “Vacant Planets” is the last track of the album, preceded by (in numerical order):
            * **Flattening of Emotions:** discusses depression and its degradation of the human mind
            * **Suicide Machine:** focused on euthanasia and the impacts of lonelyness derived from a lack of sympathy and empathy
            * **Together as One:** centered on the concept of societal discontentment through the perspective of siamese twins
            * **Secret Face:** discusses how one’s demeanor can be a lie covering their true intentions (people are very different from what they appear to be)
            * **Lack of Comprehension:** conveys a perspective on the lowlifes of society, explaining how some people are simply overcome by fear, weakness, foolishness, and most importantly, a lack of comprehension
            * **See Through Dreams:** takes a positive turn compared to the other songs. It explains how people living with blindness have heightened senses, with dreams allowing them to experience visual scenes and thoughts 
            * **Cosmic Sea:** an instrumental depiction of the vastness of the Universe
        * **Excerpt from the Lyrics:**
            * “Mysterious object of flight
            * On a voyage
            * To correct what they have done
            * What we are doing”
            * \-----------------------------------------------------
                * The premise of the song follows a group of extra-terrestrial beings traveling through space after destroying their home planet, hoping to find a way to resurrect their homeworld. “To…doing” refers to how humans are doing the same thing to their planet; climate change and environmental destruction degrade the Earth. 
            * “Perhaps submerged
            * Living in the innermost
            * Recesses of the planet
            * No choice but
            * To adapt to an underground world”
                * The destruction of the planet has forced the alien species to live underground, building a subterranean society. 
                * I believe Chuck uses the example of aliens as a parallel for the future of humanity. If we were to destroy the majority of vegetation and life on our planet, we may be forced to delve deep into the Earth to survive, finding resources that have been protected from the doings of humanity.
            * \-----------------------------------------------------
            * “Are they the examples of regression
            * A life form's abusive progression
            * In a realm so vast
            * We sit among the Vacant Planets”
                * “A life form’s abusive progression” refers to how a species, after advancing enough, becomes abusive to their environment. The prime example for this would be humans. Over thousands of years, humans have advanced both biologically and intellectually. As a result, technological advancements have been made at the cost of environmental degradation, a major issue at the present time. 
            * \-----------------------------------------------------
            * “So many worlds yet to be seen
            * That once have shared
            * The same effects that come from greed
            * Mass production”
                * Chuck ponders the idea that like the humans of Earth and the aliens roaming the universe, there are countless other planets that have been destroyed due to the excessive advancements of a species. Such progression would ultimately lead up to concepts of greed in a fully developed society, causing environmental destruction from mass-production that supports such greed.
            * \------------------------------------------------------
    * “Vacant Planets” was the most thematically unique song Chuck recorded up until the release of his later albums. He pondered ideals of extraterrestrial life, creating a parallel between the societies of aliens and humans, emphasizing the destruction of planetary environments as a result of greed and excessive advancements in technology.
    * Now, I won’t be exploring the other songs as they are essentially all themed around the Philosophy of the Mind. I personally like to view this album as an expansion upon “Within the Mind” from *Spiritual Healing*, with the tracks exploring the human entity.
    * *Human* was truly a milestone for Death. Chuck’s songwriting evolved as he matured, starting out with pure horror and gore in *Scream Bloody Gore*, transitioning to more mature and realistic forms of death in *Leprosy*, finally entering into philosophy and societal issues with *Spiritual Healing*. *Human* built upon the issues established in *Spiritual Healing*, this time focusing on the nature of being human itself.


## Individual Thought Patterns 



* *Individual Thought Patterns *is the band’s 5th album. It was recorded in 1993, and really moved forward with the technical and progressive style the band was developing.
* It built upon the themes introduced in* Human*, focusing heavily on the philosophy of human nature, especially the human mind.
*  A personal favorite of mine is “The Philosopher”. The song portrays Chuck’s opinion on modern-day philosophers, critiquing the validity of philosophy and their supposed knowledge and understanding of such ideals. 
* **Epistemology and Philosophical Skepticism** 
    * Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that focuses on the theory of knowledge. How do we know of such knowledge? Is this knowledge valid? From epistemology stems skepticism. In philosophical terms, skepticism is the idea that nothing can be absolutely known or proved. 
        * A radical way to look at these two concepts is the idea that we live in a simulation (i.e. *The Matrix*). Whatever we consider knowledge may be completely invalid as our perception of the world may be invalid. 
    * “The Philosopher” demonstrates both of these concepts, with Chuck’s skepticism of the validity and use of modern-day philosophers. 
    * Excerpt from the Lyrics:
        * “Do you feel what I feel, see what I see, hear what I hear?
        * There is a line you must draw between your dream world and reality
        * Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe?”
            * Philosophers primarily pose ideas regarding human nature, attempting to explain and comprehend such phenomena. Chuck is clearly against such generalizations of humans. “Do…hear” explains how philosophers cannot speak on the behalf of other people as they do not experience the same things as them. How can one create such assumptions and explanations of the internal workings of an individual being a completely different person? I believe the main point that Chuck is trying to convey is that it is foolish to make generalizations and assertions of human nature, especially for individuals, when all humans are simply different; he is highly skeptical of the validity of philosophical knowledge.
        * \----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * “Lies feed your judgment of others
        * Behold how the blind lead each other
        * The philosopher
        * You know so much about nothing at all”
            * “Lie…others” suggests how the basis of philosophical ideals are invalid assumptions, having no basis of truth. Philosophers then use such ideals to judge others.
            * “You…all” demonstrates Chuck’s belief that the so-called knowledge of philosophers is essentially useless in today’s society. Philosophers lack practical application from Chuck’s perspective, as he believes the basis of their ideals are invalid and flawed. 
        * \----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * “Your mind is not your own
        * What sounds more mentally stimulating is how you make your choice
        * So you preach about how I'm supposed to be
        * Yet you don't know your own sexuality”
            * “Your…own” can be seen as a reference to the lack of originality for philosophical ideals. Modern philosophers still use the ideals of old philosophers, such as Socrates and Plato, simply believing these ideals hold validity due to their wide acceptance and reputation. 
            * “What…choice” refers to the bias when coming to intellectual and philosophical decisions. I think a simple way to interpret this line is the common saying “It sounds and looks smart.” Philosophers may fail to accept straightforward explanations and answers to common questions, simply because it undermines their profession of deeply questioning concepts. 
            * “So…sexuality” refers to the duality of human nature. I personally think this line implies that Chuck wrote this song, not only aimed towards the specific profession of philosophers, but people in general who impose philosophical ideals. People create judgment and assert how life should be led, experienced, and how the thought process works. Yet, these same people consist of individuals who themselves are unsure of their identity. In the context of the song, sexual identity. I think it’s pretty safe to say that Chuck is critiquing the demographic of people who teach others about their lives, yet lack an understanding of their own life.
* **Determinism vs Free Will**
    * Determinism vs Free Will is a debate regarding the chain of events that occur in life. The side of determinism believes that all events occur in a chain of causes and effects. Essentially, free will simply does not exist and events occur as a result of external forces that we have no control over. 
        * For example, the event of me presenting this project right now was caused by the interactions of specific molecules that occurred prior.
    * Free will, on the other hand, is the idea that humans have full control over the events that can occur as a result of their actions; there is no pre-set course of events to take place, we have control over the actions that can result in such events. 
    * We commonly see this debate manifest in religious ideals. For instance, religions which have the concept of “God’s Plan”
    * Chuck portrays this idea with “Destiny”. The track is centered around two individuals who have a strong relationship with each other, presumably lovers, and how one of them contemplates the events that transpired between the two, concluding it was destiny’s decision.
        * Before we analyze the lyrics of the song, it is important to truly understand the meaning of destiny and where it falls in terms of determinism and free will.
            * A commonly accepted definition of destiny is that it refers to something that is supposed to happen. 
                * As the definition of destiny is abstract in itself, it can fall towards determinism or free will.
                    * In terms of determinism, destiny may essentially be the ultimate outcome of all the prior events that took place, including the pre-set course of our actions (which took place due to external forces).
                    * In terms of free will, destiny may be the “destination” that an individual is supposed to reach. However, they have complete freedom and choice over the actions they may take. The actions will, ultimately, lead towards that destined destination.
        * Excerpt from the Lyrics:
            * “Time is a thing we must accept
            * The unexpected I sometimes fear
            * Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens
            * When things fall into place”
                * “Time…fear” can be interpreted as the narrator’s concern for the unpredictability of life. Events can occur without any prior warning, often surprising or shocking people. The prime example of this would be unexpected tragedy, a very common fear among people.
                * From my perspective, “Just…place” sets up the narrator's belief in determinism for the course of their life. “...no excuse for what happens When things fall into place” portrays the idea that events in life occur according to a predetermined plan (hence, “things fall into place”)
            * \-------------------------------------------------------------------------
            * “I know there is no way to avoid 
            * The pain that we must go through
            * To find the other half that is true”
                * This section of the lyrics enforces the narrator's perspective that life is deterministic. In the case of the narrator’s life, this determinism is applied to their relationship with another person, appearing to be a relationship of love. 
                    * They have to endure the predetermined events causing them pain. Getting through these events, however, will build a deep connection, allowing the lovers to fully understand and see their connection (“find the other half that is true”).
            * \-------------------------------------------------------------------------
            * “Destiny is what we all seek
            * Destiny was waiting for you and me”
                * Pretty self-explanatory.
            * \-------------------------------------------------------------------------
            * “Years of questioning 
            * Why things happen the way they do in life
            * Wishing that I could turn back time
            * So we could join our souls”
                * “Years…life” refers to the narrator questioning the purpose behind the events that took place. 
                    * I personally would ask myself, “Did these events happen because I chose this path, or were they the result of things I had no control over?”
                        * Just to put my opinion out there, I think the determinism vs free will debate also functions as a way to deal with guilt. People may use determinism to assert that they had no fault in certain events, while free will leans towards admitting and understanding the consequences of your choices and actions.
                * “So…souls” enforces the song’s focus on the relationship between the narrator and their lover.
            * \-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * “Destiny” is one of my favorite songs on the album. The heavy main riff, paired with the upbeat rhythm never fails to make me headbang. But more importantly, the lyrics really enforce the idea that we simply have no control over the occurrence of certain events. Chuck portrayed the ideal of destiny and determinism through a lover’s reflection of the events that took place throughout their relationship. Perhaps this song was of great importance to Chuck, where he himself was the narrator depicted in the song.
* *Individual Thought Patterns* was and is an amazing album, demonstrating the musical genius behind *Death*. The album really solidified the band’s movement towards a more technical and progressive tune on the instrumental side, while building upon relatable themes such as issues in society and the natures of the human mind for lyrical content. Chuck continues to develop this instrumental and lyrical style in his last two albums, *Symbolic* and *The Sound of Perseverance*.


## Conclusion



* I won’t be covering Chuck’s last two albums, *Symbolic* and *The Sound of Perseverance*, for the sake of time (also because I already hit all the concepts I needed 🤘). However, they are no exception from Chuck’s musical genius. *Symbolic* is often considered to be the peak of Death’s musical prowess, with wide acclaim and praise for the unique instrumental tone and catchy riffs employed in the album.
* Charles “Chuck” Schuldiner was a musical genius. We sadly lost the legend to brain cancer in 2001, yet his music lives eternally. 
    * He defined the death metal genre, created what many people agree to be 7, flawless albums. Most importantly, he pushed the boundaries of music. He demonstrated how metal, like all other music genres, can constantly change and evolve, employing deeply meaningful themes and killer instrumentals. 
* *Death* has been an extremely important band to me. Chuck’s music emphasized the importance of deep, meaningful lyrics in songs. He helped me understand the importance of conversing with meaning, with significance, with understanding the explanation and reasoning behind things. I strive to be like Chuck: a musical and guitar genius, a positive, open minded person, and a man of meaningful words and wisdom.
